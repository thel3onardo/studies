### Built-in types in Dart

#### Number types

Dart numbers can be classified in two types:

- int -> intended for numbers no large than 64-bit size(depending on platform). In web, int values are converted to JavaScript numbers (aka 64-bit floating point values)
- double -> intended for floating-point numbers
- num -> both *int* and *double*

> Both int and double are subtypes of the num type
